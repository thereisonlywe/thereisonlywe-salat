### This is a complete, open-source and easy-to-use Quran recitation and Salah practice API for to be used in Java and Android programming. It has two versions with similar methods; one for desktop (classic Java) and another for Android. It is dependent on ["thereisonlywe-quran" API](https://github.com/thereisonlywe/thereisonlywe-quran), and thus you need to have that project (or its binaries) on your path. Installation is very straight forward; just add .jar files inside "bin" directory as libraries to your project and you are all set.

**Check "doc" folder for a complete methods overview.
